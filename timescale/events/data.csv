13.7,9,"The observable universe exists as an infinitesimal point, and for unknown reasons, erupts. In a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a second, the universe goes from a size a million billion billion times smaller than an atom, to a size larger than 100 billion galaxies. Hydrogen is soon created, the fundamental building block for all other structure in the universe. Due to the asymmetric distribution of the substance, and the emergence of gravity, galaxies begin to form."
13,9,"With high pressures and temperatures above 18 million degrees Fahrenheit, hydrogen atoms smash together creating helium. As a result, the first stars are born, and there is light. Inside these stars, 25 of the most common elements are manufactured, giving the universe more chemical variety for sculpting, including lithium, nitrogen, silicon, carbon, oxygen, iron. It is these elements that will spur the Iron Age. Around this time, the earliest starts begin to die and explode, only millions of years after their birth. These supernovas fuse chemicals too heavy for stars to fuse, such as gold, copper, uranium, and bronze. It is these elements that will spur the Bronze Age. The chemistry set of elements forged by starts and supernovas complete the periodic table. In this sense our bodies and everything we know is made of stardust. Supernovas are critical to our existence."
8,9,"As the life cycles of stars continue, the universe continues mixing the resulting elements and gradually the density of heavy elements increases."
4.6,9,"A special star is born: our sun. Most of the dust in the solar system is pulled to the sun, but in the process gravity manages to pull together clumps of dust into what we call planets. The third planet from sun, our Earth, is covered with molten rock and spins so rapidly that days last a mere 6 hours. Lighter elements float to the Earth's surface forming a crust, while heavier elements sink and form Earth's iron, nickel core. This molten metal core yields the magnetic force surrounding Earth that protects us for the Sun's particles. It is now, after two third of the history of the universe has passed, that the story of Earth begins."
4.5,9,"An asteroid the size of Mars collides with the planet, altering the planet's momentum, and spewing into space debris that in less a year is gathered together by gravity to form the Moon. This change in momentum and the gravitational pull of the Moon slows the Earth's rotation and allows the planet to spin steadily, protecting future life from wild climate swings. But in addition, the Earth becomes tilted on its axis of rotation, giving rise to mild and consistent climate swings essential for life's evolution: the seasons.
4.4,9,"Though Earth's magnetic field will allow explorers to navigate the oceans using a compass, those oceans are yet to be created. With steam filling the atmosphere, and the planet gradually cooling, it begins to rain. For millions of years it rains, and the rain doesn't stop. The rain forms puddles, basins, ponds, lakes, rivers, and eventually oceans that cover two thirds of the planet's surface."
3.8,9,"Deep under the oceans, six simple elements including hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen, combine creating complex substance structures, the most spectacular of which is a long spiral we call DNA. The catalysts are a mystery, but suddenly miniscule chemical blobs, known today as cells or more specifically bacterial cells, begin to self-replicate. With cellular division, life begins. For the next three billion years, micros like these keep the earth to themselves."
2.5,9,"A particular form of bacteria discovers how to use the energy of the sun, and in the process creates an important waist product: oxygen. The ocean is filled with iron particles, and as the oxygen waist product grows in volume, the oxygen rusts the iron. Flakes of rusted iron pile on the ocean floor. It is these deposits that will give rise to steel and drive the Industrial Revolution. Once all the iron in the oceans is rusted, the oxygen begins to fill the ocean and rise to the surface filling the atmosphere. The sky turns blue, and so do the oceans. Oceanic life forms begin to learn to life off this abundant element of oxygen, and the gradually learn to do so efficiently."
550,6,"The planet undergoes it fourteen millionth birthday. Next comes the biological version of the Big Bang: the Cambrian Explosion. With oxygen levels higher than ever before, the size and complexity of species goes wild. Over the next thirty million years, the few major animal groups evolve. One such group is that of the bony fish. These fish are the ancestors of all vertebrates, such as ourselves. This is due to a few fundamental body parts of the fish's body design, such as a spine, a jaw, and teeth."
500,6,"For roughly three billion years, life has kept to the oceans. But for the last half billion years until today, life makes its move onto land. With an ozone layer of oxygen to offer protection from radiation, plants make the move first. Over millions of years, forests begin to cover land mass, sculpting an environment for animals to follow plants in expanding from the oceans to the land."
400,6,"Amphibians begin learning to live on land, consuming oxygen in gas form instead of liquid form. But these animals still must live next to the ocean, most importantly for purposes of reproduction. For life to spread to all terrains and corners of the planet, animals must cut this final tie with the ocean. Certain amphibians discover how to replace jelly-like eggs that dry out on land with hard-shelled eggs that contain the moisture. These amphibians evolve into reptiles."
300,6,"Animals continue colonizing the land, and species diversity increases. Across the earth, plants grow, live, and die. They are then buried, compacted, and locked away deep underground they gradually transform into coal."
250,6,"An enormous surge in volcanic activity fills the atmosphere with poisonous fumes carbon dioxide, and debris blocking the sun's raise. This causes a mass die-off that throws out a large portion of the animal diversity spawned in the Cambrian Explosion. More than 70% of species go extinct. This is known as the Permian Extinction. In the last 500 million years, mass extension has appeared five times, and each occurrence has allowed new species to take hold. This time, the new rulers of earth are the dinosaurs."
150,6,"Dinosaurs reign the earth for 160 million years. While these titan animals roam the earth, our direct ancestors are mammals no larger than a cat, scurrying around their feet trying to steel dinosaur eggs and living on the fringes."
100,6,"During the time of the dinosaurs, other important events occur. The first hardwood forests appear. The Moon's gravity finally settles earth into a 24 hour day. And the mass continent of Pangaea starts to split, separating modern Africa from South America, making way for the Atlantic Ocean. This new ocean is too become one of the defining barriers of human history, as the vast gulf between the Old and New World."
65,6,"Six miles wide, an asteroid hurdles towards earth. Smashing into modern Mexico it creates a dust cloud that blocks out the sun causing temperatures to plummet. After only a few years, every land animal weighing over fifty pounds goes extinct. It is this mass extinction that gives mammals, and hence primates, a chance to rise and seize control. These mammals have evolved forward facing eyes allowing for depth perception, and flexible hands with five digits."
50,6,"Our primate ancestors evolve on a planet so hot there are jungles at the poles. As the continents drift taking their modern positions, modern day Northern Africa remains submerged below an ancient sea that will become the Mediterranean. At the bottom of this sea are tiny shellfish whose shells made of calcium and carbon pile up on the sea floor over millions of years. These shell deposits form into the limestone that will be used to build the Great Egyptian Pyramids. Sit on a rock of a pyramid and it is evident the stone is made of 50 million year old seashells."
10,6,"A world has taken shape that we would begin to recognize. The Colorado river has carved out the Grand Canyon. The Himalayas have risen so tall they disrupt weather patterns, setting the stage for a colder planet. Panama rises from the ocean, connecting North and South America, disrupting ocean currents and tilting the planet towards an ice age."
7,6,"While the planet grows colder, our primate ancestors keep to the tropics. But there is a newcomer to their environment. In fact, this species is so well designed it will invade, luckily to our ancestors' benefit, nearly every environment on the planet simultaneously. This species is grass, creating the African Savanna, the Eurasian Steppe, the South American Grasslands, and the North American Prairies."
6,6,"As grasslands take over woodlands in Africa, some primates, such as apes, begin to make a move down from the trees, seeking survival in a stark, new habitat. With high grasses, such a habitat is to the advantage of those primates that can walk on two feet, keeping their heads high to watch for prey and predators. As apes learn to stand on two feet, their hands grow to be free. This is a revolutionary advance, as these hands will shape human history over the coming eras."
3,6,"Early hominids roam the African Planes. The rocks under their feet are loaded with the element silicon. The second most abundant element on Earth's surface, silicon was forged billions of years earlier in the center of stars. Silicon can combine with oxygen to form into crystals that make solid rock. This rock that can chipped without shattering. Our ancestor forged these rocks into tools, such as hammers and spears, creating the first instance of technology. Simple modification of stone offered a thousand new possibilities. This is the Stone Age."
1.5,6,"Earth is unique in its ability to sustain fire. Earth contains a plethora of the two essential ingredients. One is fuel in the form of plants, and the other is gaseous oxygen. The early humans begin to experiment with the strange phenomenon and bring it firmly under control by 800,000 years ago. Using fire to cook lets humans to gain more calories, more quickly, with a smaller stomachs, enabling them to build bigger brains. In the not too distance future, fire will be used to turn clay into pottery, metal into weapons, and water into steam power."
400,3,"Human population is an estimated million. The modern human is recognizable having fully taken shape. The voice box has descended in the throat allowing for a wider variety of complex sounds. Language emerges. Humans gain an enormous advantage no other creature on the planet has, the ability to share detailed information, such a personal experience. This information is shared in space, across physical distances, and in time, across generations. Collaboration and the resulting mutual benefit begins to shape human culture as we know it.
200,3,"Humans intelligence grows exponentially. With primitive tools, communication, and control of fire, human activity begins to take global scale. On paths millions of years in the making by early humans, our species begins to populate the planet. The joining of continents has formed the 33 million square mile land mass of Afro-Eurasia. As a result, more than half the land on Earth can be reached by foot. Homo sapiens are one of the few species that can live in every environment simultaneously, a game changing advantage entailing that extinction of homo sapiens in one environment does not mean extinction of the species."
100,3,"The ice age, millions of years in the making, crawls South across the planet. While in the North humans' capacity for survival is tested like never before, in the South human conquest continues as far as Oceania. As the ice age peaks, the march of man reaches the frigid tundra of Siberia. While huge swaths of water get locked up into ice, ocean levels fall, and humans make the journey across the Bering Strait into North America. The growth of human conquest is accompanied by the growth of the human intellect. Planning, abstract thinking, and written symbols and art begin to take hold. Perhaps this revolution is as radical as that of language, hundreds of thousands of years earlier."
50,3,"Though humans have now taken center stage on Earth, reaching every corner of the planet, it is humbling to remember what a tiny slice of history we occupy. Suppose we compress the 14 billion year life of the universe into the last 14 years. On this scale, life would have appeared 3 years ago, larger species beyond bacteria would have arrived 7 months ago. The dinosaurs would have gone extinct three weeks ago. The recorded history of man would span the last three minutes, and the modern industrial world would have arrived 6 seconds ago."
15,3,"The ice age begins to end and as glaciers recede they carve our giant rivers and bays. In the process new rivers form around the world, that will play a large role in directing future human conquest. In particular, increased rain fall in Africa causes Lake Victoria to overflow, creating the Nile River. The Tigris and the Euphrates rivers also emerge in modern day Iraq. These three new rivers give rise to the Fertile Crescent that will in turn give rise to the earliest form of civilization."
12,3,"As the planet regains warmth, plants and animals grow more abundant, offering more to humans in one place reducing the need for movement. Permanent settlements begin to take shape. Populations begin to grow. A large population means hunting large animals over large distances is no longer sufficient. The domestication of animals, such as goats and cattle begins. Though grass has been around for millions of years, our hunter gatherer ancestors have ignored the plant family since the beginning. But with so many mouths to feed, they begin to consider the plant in a new light known as agriculture. Humans learn the essential task of sowing seeds, and they begin to grow grasses such as sugarcane, wheat, rye, and barley. Civilization begins to depend on these staple crops."
10,3,"In a half dozen regions around the world, farming begins to shape civilizations. But nowhere is this revolution more rapidly occurring than in the Fertile Crescent of the Middle East. More animals such as cattle, pigs, sheep, and goats are domesticated there than anywhere. While rice has taken hold in Asia, and corn in South America, more varieties of plants, such as lentils and figs, are farmed in the Fertile Crescent than anywhere. This region has an advantage due to the natural resources so readily available such as fresh water and rich soil. While these humans progress, those humans in regions such as Africa make little progress with so few plants and animals available for domestication. This relative advantage will grow more and more profound as human history plays out, and it will relate directly to power and wealth. This difference is strikingly clear in the slave trade of the 18th century, and we even still see this asymmetry today."
7,3,"Horses originally evolved in the Americas, though during the ice age many of them died out with other large mammals. Some of them, however, escaped across the Bering Strait, and began spreading across the great grasslands of Eurasia. Around this time, nomads in central Asia learn how to tame these powerful animals, and it isn't for another five thousand years that horses will cross the Atlantic, completing the circle back to their origin. Domestication of horses will accelerate civilizations around the world in many respects, from the efficiency of work to the intensity of warfare."
6,3,"In the Fertile Crescent, the civilizations of Mesopotamia take shape, drawing in large populations, and becoming centers of wealth, and innovation. These centers are what we can call humans' earliest cities. Uruk is one such city containing 50 thousand people living in a density equivalent to that of Manhattan. These people depend on a few primary crops, such as wheat and barley that have identical yearly cycles. This poses a challenge, and one that is solved by a multifaceted system. Security systems, such as armies, are made to protect the grains. The beginning of politics emerges to manage the crops. Accounting and symbolic writing systems are invented to organize the information. We have depended upon these critical institutions ever since."
5,3,"Humans have wondered the globe for a hundred thousand years. For the first time, trade between civilizations begins, and this practice continues until today at ever increasing scales. With large caravans of donkeys, people exchange not only goods, but ideas, and these exchanges are mutually beneficial as each participant learns from the others. With material exchange come cultural exchange and stories begin to spread across regions. These civilizations will be some of the first described in the Bible."
4,3,"Humans have gone from humble huts to massive monuments, such as Stonehenge and the Great Pyramids of Giza. In Mesopotamia, temples climb higher towards the heavens, inspiring stories like the Tower of Babble. These temples are built from what we call asphalt, oozing from the seepages of the Euphrates. This is the first of a set of products that will heavily influence the modern world: petroleum products. A thinner substance accompanies the asphalt that the Sumerians try to avoid because it catches fire to easily: gasoline. These resources offer a first indication that this region will one day become a place of wealth and warfare."
3.2,3,"A couple thousand years earlier, the Sumerians invented one of the most essential pieces of human technology: the wheel. Though it was first used for pottery, it was soon paired with the horse to make chariots. At this time, a clash of chariot driven civilizations cuts off supply of copper and tin. Met with a challenge, metal smiths discover that by working at higher temperatures, iron can be much strong and sharper than previous metals. This discovery marks the beginning of the Iron Age."
